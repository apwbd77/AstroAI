Program_1.ipynb is the code for galaxy classification and Program_2.ipynb is the code for lamost DR9 spectrum classification.
predict_model_01.csv and predict_model.csv are the result for spectrum in file test_data.fits. predict_model_01.csv is predicted by the model trained with train_data_01.fits while predict_model.csv is predicted by the model trained with all the fits file.
